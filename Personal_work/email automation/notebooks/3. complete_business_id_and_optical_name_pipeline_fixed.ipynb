    "# 🔄 Complete Business ID and Optical Name Pipeline (Fixed)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs complete data processing in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Processing Order:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: `email_customer_matched_full.csv`, `processed_customer_data.csv`\n",
    "2. **Business ID Assignment by from_address**: Same from_address gets same business_id\n",
    "3. **Missing Business ID Handling**: Fill remaining NaN business_id with unused business_id from customer_data\n",
    "4. **Optical Name Generation**: Generate consistent random optical names by business_id\n",
    "5. **Mapping Application**: Add optical_name column to both DataFrames\n",
    "6. **Verification**: Check if all business_id and optical_name are completely filled\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goals:\n",
    "- Same from_address always gets same business_id\n",
    "- No NaN business_id in any row\n",
    "- No NaN optical_name in any row\n",
    "- Same business_id always gets same optical_name\n",
    "- Prioritize business_id from customer_data"
